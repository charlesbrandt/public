Docker is a lighter weight alternative to a full virtual machine.
Virtual machines are handy tools as well, but require ore resources and duplicate a lot of the operating system files.

Docker has great documentation, and I have been following along there:
https://docs.docker.com/

Engine is the core of it all:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/

and this is a great overview:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/

https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/



This cheat sheet is a great overview, and closely resembles what these notes cover:

When you 'run' a command with docker, you specify the docker image to use to run it. The run command will download the image, build the container (if they don't exist already), and then run the command.

    docker run mhart/alpine-node node --version

see a list of *currently running* docker containers:

    docker ps
    
connect to a (already running) docker container:

    docker attach loving_heisenberg 

start and connect to a docker container:

    docker exec -it <containerIdOrName> bash
    docker exec -it docker_web_run_1 bash

    docker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash <imageID>
    docker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash docker_web_run_1

## Shares & Storage

It is possible to share storage between the host and containers. 

Volumes are encapsulated in the container engine itself (separate from the host):

https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#start-a-container-which-creates-a-volume-using-a-volume-driver

Bind Mounts are shares between the container and the host:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/bind-mounts/#mounting-into-a-non-empty-directory-on-the-container

For deployments, a volume is a better choice. For development, a bind mount may work well. (I think!)

## Images

see a list of available docker images (see what is currently available):

    docker image ls -a

is equivalent to:

    docker images

docker images are stored in:

    /var/lib/docker
    
(don't forget, on mac docker is running in a VM, so this location is on that VM)
via:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19234831/where-are-docker-images-stored-on-the-host-machine


clear everything out (!!! dangerous !!!)

    docker image rm $(docker image ls -a -q)
    docker image rm -f $(docker image ls -a -q)

it is possible to build images, but if an image does not exist before running, then it will be built at that time

when it comes time to build a docker image (so you can ultimately deploy a running docker container), there are a few different ways to create the image:

 - start a container, make some changes, and then commit that to a new image
 - use a dockerfile to create a new image (recommended process)
 - use ansible to build the image
    - could install ansible using the docker file and then run the ansible playbook via the docker file
    - could use docker to connect to a running container (either using docker connection, or by instantiating a ssh connection to the container) and then commit those changes

Using (one of the) ansible concept seems like the ideal approach, but so far I've hit some walls making this work.

start off configuring with just docker to make sure everything works that way first. after that it should be easier to just focus on the ansible integration. 

    docker build -t simple-node .
    docker run -p 3000:3000 simple-node

Now you should be able to connect to localhost without specifying a VM host. Without the explicit forward for the port, the port won't be available:

    http://localhost:3000/
    
(does not appear that docker on mac still utilizes a separate docker-machine running on VirtualBox 2017.09.27 16:15:17)


Different dependencies will result in different sized containers. Smaller is generally better, everything else being the same:

## Networking

see a list of all IP addresses for all containers:
sudo docker ps | tail -n +2 | while read cid b; do echo -n "$cid\t"; sudo docker inspect $cid | grep IPAddress | cut -d \" -f 4; done

via:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17157721/getting-a-docker-containers-ip-address-from-the-host


wasn't sure about how to get one container to talk to another...
they've documented that well:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/networkingcontainers/

*2016.05.11 09:15:14
(on macs) set up a terminal to know how to interact with docker by running:

    eval "$(docker-machine env default)"





*2016.06.09 15:15:15 security
you don't want to include sensitive information in an image, especially if that is going to get shared on an image repository. This rules out using a Dockerfile. It's also not ideal to pass these parameters in over the command line interface, since then that gets set in the history file.

This is a nice article on the topic that recommends using docker-compose and reference an .env file for sensitive data:
https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/tutorial-protecting-sensitive-info-docker

Docker-compose is very similar in function to ansible. And then I'm back to that topic:

docker + ansible:

this a good introduction for using ansible within a Docker instance:
https://www.ansible.com/2014/02/12/installing-and-building-docker-with-ansible

looks like ansible can also control docker directly, if desired:
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/docker_module.html

that may be a good alternative to docker-compose

more development is actively happening in this space, but it is not to a stable / usable state yet

https://www.ansible.com/docker

be sure not to use:
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/docker_module.html
it has been deprecated

many others are available as part of the cloud modules in ansible core:
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_cloud_modules.html

These are the main ones:
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/docker_image_module.html
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/docker_container_module.html
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/docker_service_module.html

docker on mac uses boot2docker to configure the main docker machine
this assigns a different IP address than localhost (which is often mentioned in many of the guides.) Kitematic can help with determining the ip of the machine.
