Many different topics about Android...
focusing on installation, backups and core applications here


The main desktop in android is called a launcher or homescreen.

With Google devices, that launcher is the Google Now launcher. You cannot remove the Google search bar from the homescreens in Google Now. I find that distracting; it's a deal breaker. 

So on to other options:

KISS, Trebuchet, and Turbo are the open source launchers on that list. KISS is super minimal and clean... so far I really like it!

To get rid of the green bar at the top, I choose:
KISS Settings -> User Interface -> Theme interface -> Transparent theme or Dark transparent theme

It sounds like Trebuchet is based on CM launcher. I like CM the last time I used it.

Turbo looks like it is not being actively maintained. Maybe they have moved on to commercial endeavors?

Nova gets good reviews. Not open source, however. Many other proprietary solutions out there:
