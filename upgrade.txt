upgrading a system, 

should follow all instructions in shutdown.txt 
(up to actually turning computer off)

usually this amounts to syncing mercurial repositories locally

Binary data should be elsewhere. If not, export that now.

check with:
du -ms /c/out*
du -ms /c/binaries*

ls /c/binaries-local
ls /c/out-backups

*2014.09.16 15:14:42 
check that nothing is in default system user directory

cd
du -ms *

Desktop
and
Downloads are common options



move personal data to a separate location

be sure that all personal data and settings are backed up.  
Settings should be backed up in the form of notes and install procedures.
Once a structure is in place that is used, everything should be in that structure, and nothing unnecessary should be in it. 

(currently under /c)



if backing things up to an NTFS drive, it might be better to make a tar file of everything so that permissions are preserved correctly (otherwise scripts get reset as not executable... a hassle)

sudo tar -zcvf /media/charles/DRIVE/20130514-old_macbook-c.tgz /c



creating a bootable USB:
will need to do this before starting fresh.  On Ubuntu, there is usb-creator built in...
you can use that on a standard Ubuntu machine, but XUbuntu does not run on Gnome, so usb-creator is not available for it.

Can either make the USB manually:
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/usb-xubuntu-804-persistent-install-from-linux/

or try this utility:
http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/

sudo apt-get install unetbootin

(see also bootable_usb.txt)

****
make sure any data stored in browser extensions (link router) is also backed up
****

****
make sure to synchronize /c 
(especially if not restoring original directory structure)
