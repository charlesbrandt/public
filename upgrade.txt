sometimes /boot runs out of room
sudo dpkg --list 'linux-image*' | grep ^ii
sudo apt-get remove linux-image-VERSION
sudo apt-get autoremove

#may not be necessary, but harmless
#sudo update-grub

e.g.:

if backing things up to an NTFS drive, it might be better to make a tar file of everything so that permissions are preserved correctly (otherwise scripts get reset as not executable... a hassle)



(Ideally do this before starting fresh... new installs don't have git)
(TODO: move to shutdown or upgrade notes; link those two)
If you're upgrading to a new version, mark notes in git for the previous version so that you can go back, if needed:

    git tag 15.10

check home drive for any downloads
any other browser settings?

    sudo tar -zcvf /media/charles/DRIVE/20130514-old_macbook-c.tgz /c

    sudo tar -zcvf /media/charles/DATA/20160728-chip-nuc-c.tgz /c

if not saving the original drive (which is difficult to do) do a full system backup first.
Many ways to accomplish this:

    sudo rsync -av --exclude-from /Volumes/Backup/excludes.txt / /Volumes/Backup/20160929-mbpr-breathe-everything-root

and / or Timemachine (use disk as Timemachine backup)

*2014.09.15 18:49:42 
back up Thunderbird and those settings
charles/communicate/email-backup.txt
charles/communicate/email-configuration.txt

extract any stored data in browser, especially in local apps like "Link Router"
chrome://extensions-frame/#

If you're upgrading to a new version, mark notes in git for the previous version so that you can go back, if needed:

upgrading a system, 

should follow all instructions in shutdown.txt 
(up to actually turning computer off)

usually this amounts to syncing mercurial repositories locally

Binary data should be elsewhere. If not, export that now.

check with:
du -ms /c/out*
du -ms /c/binaries*

ls /c/binaries-local
ls /c/out-backups

*2014.09.16 15:14:42 
check that nothing is in default system user directory

cd
du -ms *

Desktop
and
Downloads are common options



move personal data to a separate location

be sure that all personal data and settings are backed up.  
Settings should be backed up in the form of notes and install procedures.
Once a structure is in place that is used, everything should be in that structure, and nothing unnecessary should be in it. 

(currently under /c)




creating a bootable USB:
will need to do this before starting fresh.  On Ubuntu, there is usb-creator built in...
you can use that on a standard Ubuntu machine, but XUbuntu does not run on Gnome, so usb-creator is not available for it.

or use this utility:
http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/

sudo apt-get install unetbootin

Or you can make the USB manually:
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/usb-xubuntu-804-persistent-install-from-linux/


(see also bootable_usb.txt)

****
make sure any data stored in browser extensions (link router) is also backed up
****

****
make sure to synchronize /c 
(especially if not restoring original directory structure)
