If on a machine with multiple workspaces or desktops, 
it's probably easiest to update the todo list for that machine 
to reflect each desktop's current task.

Now that desktops can be ordered, that order should reflect todo list priority.

Alternatively for a machine with multiple workspaces,
describe the desktops that are open
you don't have to navigate to them if you're sure you remember

manually note which workspaces are open in a new journal entry:
[now] instances [system]
1: 
2: 
3: 
4: 
5: 
6: 
7: 
[etc]

remember that specifying *other* could be just about anything (loving, non-violent)

if updates are taking too long, can restart then check for updates before launching again.
