In order from easiest to most difficult:

  - Many more options to this process now with VMs in the mix; they are an easy way to save a state without fully shutting down. However, be careful.. if there is a lot of information stored in that saved state it may be possible to loose it if the hypervisor shuts down unexpectedly. It's still a good idea to document, make snapshots, etc.

  - Take screenshots
    This is an easy way to get a good idea of what is going on on a workspace
    It may not give everything, however. Things like browser links and the specific contexts loaded in editors may be lost

  - review the corresponding workspaces file.

on posix systems
note uptime

    uptime

make new entry for that.

If on a machine with multiple workspaces or desktops,
it's probably easiest to update the todo list for that machine
to reflect each desktop's current task.

Now that desktops can be ordered, that order should reflect todo list priority.

Alternatively for a machine with multiple workspaces,
describe the desktops that are open
you don't have to navigate to them if you're sure you remember

manually note which workspaces are open in a new journal entry:
[now] instances [system]
1:
2:
3:
4:
5:
6:
7:
[etc]

remember that specifying *other* could be just about anything (loving, non-violent)

try to eject all drives
if they're busy, it may need to wait until shutdown is complete...
at that point all processes will have been terminated, even if it means closing without saving

found this at the bottom of the list...
should be one of the first things attempted
also [2010.09.27 15:03:11]
unmount any drives that are attached.
unplug cables






*2009.12.10 11:41:08 reboot.
reboot.

optionally, if online, check for software updates to your operating system
sometimes these are the actual trigger for a restart (shutdown)

if updates are taking too long, can restart then check for updates before launching again.

back things up somehow
 - rsync
 - sync_repos
 both are good

*2010.08.25 21:58:40
if possible, sync mercurial
/c/moments/mercurial_sync.py

or use TortoiseHG on windows (should have minimal repositories there)
(following does not work currently: [2010.08.26 10:57:14])
