Download an image from:
Raspberry Pi Guide - Quick Start Guide for Raspberry Pi

This is a good guide for using dd to create images:

Installing Operating System Images - Raspberry Pi Documentation
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md

Run df -h to see what devices are currently mounted.
Connect Card.
Run df -h again.
(dmesg and mount are also useful commands to hone in on the correct device)

umount /dev/sdi1

sudo dd bs=4M if=/c/out-data/2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdi

trying to remove overscan which results in a black border for pi display
1824x984
sudo raspi-config
Advanced -> Overscan

After a restart, the issue was fixed!

mini aukey power supplies do not deliver adequate power for a raspberry pi 3b. Get frequent "yellow lightening icon" in the upper right corner of the display

also [2019.06.28 09:59:34]
newer "fonken" single usb power supplies are even worse... power warning icon stays lit more frequently

pixel charger works a bit better, but still shows warning

The original raspberry pi hardware (version 1) cannot run some of the ubuntu flavors that have been developed for newer versions of Raspberry pis.
