=============================
Mac OS X Install Notes:
=============================
It's that time again.  Maybe you have a brand new computer (yay!), maybe you updated the operating system, or maybe it's just time to do some spring cleaning.  Either way...

Start with a fresh install of the operating system. 

If this is a system with an existing and used operating system in place, I prefer to wipe the drive completely for that "fresh install" feeling. Having install move the previously installed system to "Previous Systems" does not clean everything up. If you want to keep it around, it is better to move it to an archive drive of sorts.  Do that now if you haven't already.

System Images / Restores
——————————————————————————
Macs no longer come with optical media for os installations.

To create a bootable USB for installing the OS:

    https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372
    sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/OSX --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/
 
The system is also smart enough to download and install a fresh instance for you if you wipe the system clean. This is a slower process.

To be safe, it's always good to take an image of the machine at different stages of installation. Time Machine may facilitate this, but in practice, I rarely do this on a Mac.

Account Setup
————————————
Go through and answer the standard questions for Setup. These should be self explanatory.

Privacy
——————---
As of OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) Spotlight will send search queries to Apple and Microsoft automatically. I prefer to disable this:

"System Preferences...->Spotlight"
then uncheck "Spotlight Suggestions" and “Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Look up“

More info is available on the "About Spotlight Suggestions & Privacy" button in the Spotlight preferences.

General Configuration
----------------------------

*2010.04.16 13:59:48 wireless network
Make sure wireless network is enabled and connected.
Register your computer if your network requires it.


*2010.04.16 15:16:58 shared space
make a common directory for all User Accounts to use for shared information on the system. I like to use /c :


    sudo mkdir /c
    sudo chmod -R 2770 /c
    sudo chown -R charles: /c
    cd /c
    mkdir public
    cd public/
    git clone https://github.com/charlesbrandt/system
    #xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.
    git clone https://github.com/charlesbrandt/system


*2010.04.16 15:54:50 moments
install moments

    cd /c/public/
    git clone https://github.com/charlesbrandt/moments
    #-or-
    #hg clone http://bitbucket.org/cbrandt/moments /c/moments
    #-or- use a local copy
    #hg clone /Volumes/CONTEXT/moments /c/moments

    cd
    ln -s /c/public/moments/editors/emacs/.emacs .emacs
    ln -s /c/public/moments/editors/emacs/.emacs.d .emacs.d
    ln -s /c/public/moments/editors/vi/.exrc .exrc

    cp /c/public/moments/editors/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile 

    mkdir /c/out


*2009.01.30 12:17:11 emacs

download and install

open up your text editor


System Preferences
——————-----------------

*2009.01.28 19:43:17 
Change the computer name under:
System Preferences -> Sharing

*2012.08.09 11:03
System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab
disable Ctrl-arrows to navigate between spaces in Mission Control.
this interferes with Emacs
(be sure to get up and down in addition to left and right)
for left and right, use "Ctrl-Cmd-Right" or "Ctrl-Cmd-Left"
this is similar to XUbuntu and transfers easily

Option-arrows is another reasonable choice
(and doesn't appear to have any conflicts)

*2009.01.29 14:41:35 
Open System Preferences
in Date & Time:
enable Set date & time automatically
choose timezone
use 24-hour clock
Show date

*2009.10.15 16:20:41 
System Preferences -> Dock
Automatically hide and show the Dock
was keeping it on the left hand side, but that is a matter of preference
left side cons: with external monitor it can end up on monitor when plugged in

*2009.11.20 00:08:56 
System Preferences -> Sound
uncheck play user interface sound effects
turn down alert volume
check "Show volume in menu bar"

*2015.04.08 17:27:02
in Security & Privacy, set:
Require password [immediately] after sleep or screen saver begins
This way can lock computer with Ctl-Shift-Power



*2009.02.03 20:43:38 terminal
change Preferences for Terminal 
Under Settings
Use Pro, make it Default, and then make sure Pro is used for:
On startup, open: New window with settings: Pro

Making the profile Default will ensure that it applies to new tabs as well.

Background Opacity set to 95%
Use color picker to choose the same background as emacs

*2009.02.07 12:14:34 
create a link from /Volumes to /media to be more compatible with linux scripts:
sudo ln -s /Volumes /media




*2010.04.16 14:19:55 
Breathe. :)

*2010.04.16 14:16:42

download and install mercurial directly:

http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/

Or use pip:

    sudo pip install mercurial

open Terminal:

    which hg

Create a default .hgrc file:
vi ~/.hgrc

[ui]
username = Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@example.net>
ui.report_untrusted = False

This can be overridden on a repository by repository basis with the file:
<repo>/.hg/hgrc

Change Desktop Background
(Ctl-Click on desktop for option)
For Default I prefer Solid Gray Dark... can always customize later in other instances.
also [2016.10.04 22:00:28]
it can be useful to set different backgrounds for different spaces
this makes it easier to find the one you're looking for if there are many


*2012.08.09 12:13:01 
clone any other personal repositories as needed

hg clone /media/CONTEXT/mindstream /c/mindstream

cd /c/moments
sudo python setup.py develop

cd /c/mindstream
sudo python setup.py develop


*2009.01.28 20:30:05 
Check for software updates
this can take a while to download


*2014.11.21 09:10:23
Make Chrome launch in a private mode by default...
easy enough to open a non private mode if you want to be tracked (log in to accounts)

Open Apple Script Editor:

tell application "Google Chrome"
	make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}
	activate
end tell

Export as application. Change icon. Have saved a completed version to /c/out

helps with virtualenv
https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv
brew install autoenv
echo 'source /usr/local/opt/autoenv/activate.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile

and while you're at it try to use virtualenv

USE THIS VERSION:

the old version from microsoft directly does not appear to be in development any longer. (or simply not maintained through that channel)
Going to try out the version from Apple (AppStore) instead

rearrange notes if anything would have made it easier to edit these instructions on your new system sooner.
