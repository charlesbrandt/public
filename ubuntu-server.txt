Focusing on a server, the requirements are a bit different. It doesn't matter if the server is physical or virtual.

After installing Ubuntu Server, log in to the machine's console.

Best to enable SSH service so you can connect remotely. This is a nice, up-to-date write up of the different considerations for ssh configuration.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Then, SSH access should be on and available remotely

It might be a better idea to use SSH Keys and disable password authentication, especially on a publicly visible server
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config


From here, it probably makes sense to use a tool like ansible to help configure the machine in a way that is easy to repeat:

/c/some_project/code 
virtualenv ansible

#this assumes autoenv
vi ansible/.env

#add the following:
source bin/activate

cd ansible

pip install ansible
