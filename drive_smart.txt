For checking the S.M.A.R.T status of a drive on linux, this looks like a good tool:

sudo apt-get install smartmontools

sudo smartctl -i /dev/sda



If this command fails, you may need to let smartctl know what type of hard drive interface you’re using:

$ sudo smartctl -d TYPE -i /dev/sda

where TYPE is usually one of ata, scsi, or sat (for serial ata).


Now that smartctl can access the drive, let’s turn on some features. Run the following command:

$ sudo smartctl -s on -o on -S on /dev/sda

-s on: This turns on S.M.A.R.T. support or does nothing if it’s already enabled.
-o on: This turns on offline data collection. Offline data collection periodically updates certain S.M.A.R.T. attributes. Theoretically this could have a performance impact. However, from the smartctl man page:
Normally, the disk will suspend offline testing while disk accesses are taking place, and then automatically resume it when the disk would otherwise be idle, so  in  practice  it has little effect.

-S on: This enables “autosave of device vendor-specific Attributes”.


Next, let’s check the overall health:

$ sudo smartctl -H /dev/sda

This command should return:

=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===
SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED

If it doesn’t return PASSED, you should immediately backup all your data. Your hard drive is probably failing.





Next, let’s make sure that the drive supports self-tests. I have yet to see a drive that doesn’t, but the following command also gives time estimates for each test:

$ sudo smartctl -c /dev/sda

I won’t list the complete output because it’s somewhat lengthy. Make sure “Self-test supported” appears in the “Offline data collection capabilities” section. Also, look for output similar to:

Short self-test routine
recommended polling time:        (   2) minutes.
Extended self-test routine
recommended polling time:        ( 127) minutes.
These are rough estimates of how long the short and long self-test’s will take respectively. Let’s run the short test:

$ sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sda

On my drive, this test should take 2 minutes, but this obviously varies. You can run:

$ sudo smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda

to check results. Unfortunately, there’s no way to check progress, so just keep running that command until the results show up. A successful run will look like:

=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===
SMART Self-test log structure revision number 1
Num  Test_Description    Status                  Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error
# 1  Short offline       Completed without error       00%     21472         -
Now, do the same for the long self-test:

$ sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sda

The long test can take a significant amount of time. You might want to run it overnight and check for the results in the morning. If either test fails, you should immediately backup all your data and read the last section of this guide.
