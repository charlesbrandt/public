## Development / Application Server

SimpleHTTPServer is now available here:

    python3 -m http.server

Something else?

The trouble with using the Python webserver for production is that it is single threaded and doesn't scale well to multiple simultaneous requests.

You should have a webserver running, especially one in a container.
This makes it easier to deploy to external services.

## Apache

Go with whatever you can get running quickly
