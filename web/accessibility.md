# Accessibility

Often abbreviated as "a11y". There are 11 characters between the 'a' and the 'y' in 'accessibility'. Plus, it looks like "ally", which is a good thing to be!

Touches on many other topics, including:

  - design
  - user interface 
  - components

## Summary

If it's possible to use a native html element to implement a feature on a page, do that. But that also means using it the way it was intended. For some elements, the line is a bit blurry.

## WCAG

https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/

A resource called Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) outlines strategies and resources for creating accessible sites. Authored and vetted by a cadre of international experts, WCAG includes best practices for mobile devices.

## Buttons vs Links

Based on my reading, to summarize, a button is meant to take an action in a form on a page. A link is meant to take you somewhere else. Either can be styled to look any number of ways. If the object performs an action, use a button.

Button versus Link | Introduction to Accessibility

Use buttons for buttons! (actions)

links take you to different pages

button
vs
.button

can mark up both as needed (make them different or similar)

e.g. sign up and log in can stay as link but look like buttons

Search button should be a button

## Alt tags for SVG

Alt tags are helpful for any image.

https://svgontheweb.com/#implementation

If using a standard `<img>` tag, just use `alt`

"Note that this method limits manipulation functionality."

### Embedded

It is is also possible to embed description tags directly in the svg file itself.

Be sure to only describe information contained in the image.

> In general, HTML5 tries to discourage authors from providing content that's hidden from sighted users, because (a) it often contains new information that would be of use to sighted users, (b) it's frequently poorly written because there's little feedback to the (normally) sighted author, and (c) it is not maintained as carefully and therefore can go stale quickly.

```
<svg role="img" aria-label="[title + description]">
  <title>[title]</title>
  <desc>[long description]</desc>
  ...
</svg>
```

Use SVG for visual elements

The CSS 3 line bar hamburger menu is cute
But it's one more hoop to have to jump through to get a visual element rendered to the screen
browsers should support svg at this point.

## Firefox

### Reader view

Reader view in Firefox

Not strictly an accessibility feature
but making information easier to read makes it more accessible in my opinion

Didn't find an easy way to enable it by default for all pages

supposedly open:

    about:config

and set to true:

    reader.parse-on-load.force-enabled
