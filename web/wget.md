# Wget

`wget` is a good tool for simple scraping scenarios.

It is similar to `curl`, but `curl` is better suited for testing web connections.

## wget vs curl

The main differences are:

    wget's major strong side compared to curl is its ability to download recursively.
    wget is command line only. There's no lib or anything, but curl's features are powered by libcurl.
    curl supports FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, TELNET, DICT, LDAP, LDAPS, FILE, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, RTMP and RTSP. wget supports HTTP, HTTPS and FTP.
    curl builds and runs on more platforms than wget.
    wget is released under a free software copyleft license (the GNU GPL). curl is released under a free software permissive license (a MIT derivate).
    curl offers upload and sending capabilities. wget only offers plain HTTP POST support.

## Wget

Wget requires no extra options to simply download a remote URL to a local file, while curl requires -o or -O.

for notes on scraping web pages, and other forms of communication, see the communicate module. That functionality has been abstracted out, but it is tricky to find:

Grab the wget source code from http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/wget-1.9.1.tar.gz (or get the latest here) . Open a terminal window and follow along:

tar xzf wget-1.9.1.tar.gz
cd wget-1.9.1
./configure
make
sudo make install

The wget binary should now be in your /usr/local/bin folder. Letâ€™s also put /usr/local/bin in the shell path so we can type wget from the command line rather than the tedious /usr/local/bin/wget when we want to run the program. This is accomplished by editing ~/.bash_profile to add the following line:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin; export PATH

To get the shell to re-read this file again, type source ~/.bash_profile. Now whenever you start the terminal, /usr/local/bin will be in the path.
