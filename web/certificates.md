# SSL Certificates

Web certificates facilitate traffic between a web browser and a web server to be encrypted, and ensure that only the server can read the contents of the traffic. 

Lets Encrypt -- it's hard to beat the price: free

## Local Certificates

During development, it helps to replicate encryption the way it will be used in production. However, for local services you won't have a certificate signed by a public certificate of authority provider (CA). 

Let's Encrypt recommends the following:

Certificates for localhost - Let's Encrypt

Unfortunately, in Chrome browsers, this leads to all sorts of issues.

Even when importing the certificates
in Chrome -> Settings -> Security -> Manage Certificates

## Cypress

Testing with Cypress opens up a few additional challenges. 

So far I have not been able to test a local service with a self-signed certificate using Chrome browsers. Firefox works. 


I mounted the generated certificates so they are available within the Cypress container (in `docker-compose.yml`)

``` yaml
    volumes:
      - ./web/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl

```

A long thread about getting Chrome to work -- wasn't able to get this working.
