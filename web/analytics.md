## Google Analytics

Looks like it might be possible to export Google Analytics data by:

1.  Creating Google OAuth Client Config and
2.  Authorizing client to export your Google Analytics data.

## Open Web Analytics

I previously had some difficulty getting the client to work in a vue context. Maybe it didn't need to be integrated with vue?

Their Heatmap feature is not a premium paid add-on.

However, I had difficulty getting their agent to work within a vue-based application.
