# Web Analytics

Looking at open source alternatives to Google Analytics.

Matomo (previously Piwik) and Open Web Analytics are two open source options that come up.

## Google Analytics

Looks like it might be possible to export Google Analytics data by:

1.  Creating Google OAuth Client Config and
2.  Authorizing client to export your Google Analytics data.

## Open Web Analytics

Leaning toward Open Web Analytics. Their Heatmap feature is not a premium paid add-on.

However, I had difficulty getting their agent to work within a vue-based application.
