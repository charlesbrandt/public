## Ngrok 

ngrok can expose a local service (e.g. in development) to the outside world:

https://ngrok.com/product
ngrok - secure introspectable tunnels to localhost
https://ngrok.com/pricing
ngrok - secure introspectable tunnels to localhost


## Content Managed Hosting

 These days I recommend squarespace.com. They make the process pretty intuitive.


## Free Solutions

The easiest option is to use a free hosted solution like [google sites](http://sites.google.com/), blogger, wordpress, facebook, myspace, livejournal, twitter, etc. These solutions are _very_ user friendly and easy to get started. If you don't have much experience creating web sites, I encourage you to start here. These solutions will help you get familiar with some of the concepts of creating a website.

Even if you want your site to do more eventually, this is a great place to start. Having something in place lets gives you a frame of reference to help you define what else you need. At the very least, you'll start organizing the content you'll need for other solutions. At the very best, this option might do everything you wanted it to. Great!
