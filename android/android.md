# Android

If you're running an android device, you're basically running linux 
in a very locked down mode. 

I usually look at the apps that I use regularly from my previous phone
and focus on installing those first. Resist the temptation to install
lots of other extra (untested) apps at this point. 

My first screen is the core applications that I use most frequently 
in day to day activities. The second screen is for apps that I use more often when traveling or I'm out and about. 

But one of the first apps to install is Termux! This gives you back all of those core linux features.

Those notes are being tracked in [Termux](termux.md)
