# Pi Operating Systems

Choose the right foundation for the type of system you deploy. 

The Raspberry Pi Imager helps you choose and flash your media:

```
sudo apt install rpi-imager
rpi-imager
```

## Flash the image

Alternative ways to flash the image if the above `rpi-imager` does not suit your needs

### Balena Etcher

Download and run Etcher:

https://etcher.io/

This has been adopted by Rasperry Pi and rebranded and expanded. At least the overall process feels the same.

Some good interesting projects shown during write phase.

### Backing up

Before you re-use an SD card for a new device, be sure to back them up. 
Make an image. Ideally there may be a way to run it as a virtual machine if needed? At least a way to mount it as a file system and extract necessary information from the device. 

On linux, `dd` is a great option that's always available. 

1. Plug in card via card reader

```
sudo fdisk -l
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sde of=~/MyImage.img
```

Ideally you'd try recreating the image in reverse to make sure everything works as expected. And use a different SD card. 

If you don't have one available for testing, try mounting the image and browsing the filesystem. [Ubuntu allows double-clicking the `.img` file to mount read-only?]

### dd

Run df -h to see what devices are currently mounted.
Connect Card.
Run df -h again.
(dmesg and mount are also useful commands to hone in on the correct device)

    umount /dev/sdi1

    sudo dd bs=4M if=/c/out-data/2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdi

## Install SD to Pi

After the flash is complete, insert the SD card into the Pi and connect all the peripherals. Power on the Pi.
