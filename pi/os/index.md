# Raspberry Pi References

## OS

https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/

sudo apt install rpi-imager

run with `rpi-imager`

decide on a base OS


## Ubuntu

https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi  
Install Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi | Ubuntu  

If you're not installing a pre-made image configured for a specific application (e.g. Plex, Home Assistant, Motion Eye, etc...), this is a good foundation to start with. Can add a gui later if you're not sure if it's for desktop or server use. 

Ubuntu Server 20.04 seems to be the only way to get 64bit support. Great!

Or is Ubuntu a good choice to standardize? That's what I use for my systems. 

Is it too memory hungry?

Confirmed it works with Rasberry Pi 4 (8GB)

Must use 64bit OS for 8GB of memory version...
if running 32bit os, don't buy anything bigger than 4GB of memory.


Does 64 bit OS work in raspberry pi zero W? Lets find out. No.

64 bit OS does not work with Raspberry Pi Zero W.


32 Bit ubuntu (20.04) did not boot raspberry pi zero w

seems to just hang. 



## Raspberry Pi OS

Use for raspberry pi zero W

Maybe 32 Bit Ubuntu does not work with Raspberry Pi Zero W? 

In that case, 32 bit Raspberry Pi OS is the best choice?

may be good for pis intended for device service (e.g. camera

Can use a spare raspberry pi 4 (4GB memory) to run the install and set things up more efficiently)
(probably good enough for most server purposes)

<< --- install / setup on pi zero is slooooow
