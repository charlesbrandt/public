### Power Supplies
mini aukey power supplies do not deliver adequate power for a raspberry pi 3b. Get frequent "yellow lightening icon" in the upper right corner of the display

also [2019.06.28 09:59:34]
newer "fonken" single usb power supplies are even worse... power warning icon stays lit more frequently

pixel charger works a bit better, but still shows warning


### Pi versions limitations

Not all pis can run all software. 

The original raspberry pi hardware (version 1) cannot run some of the ubuntu flavors that have been developed for newer versions of Raspberry pis.
