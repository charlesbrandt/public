## Getting started

### Types of Pis

TODO: hardware lists and references


[power supplies](power-supply.md)  

In addition to a good power supply
it's important to make sure you have a good powered usb hub before attempting to connect peripherals. Even a wired usb keyboard and mouse can be too much for a pi zero, I've found. 


### Operating System

[OS Selection & Installation](os/index.md)  


Once you've got your system install, it's time to configure what the system runs: [Ubuntu](../system/linux/ubuntu.md)



## Projects Using Pi

### Camera

### Time clock

aka a Digital Time Keeping System
