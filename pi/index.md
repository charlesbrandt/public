## Getting started

- Choose your hardware
- Choose your operating system
- Choose any services

## Hardware

TODO: hardware lists and references

### Power

[power supplies](power-supply.md)  

In addition to a good power supply
it's important to make sure you have a good powered usb hub before attempting to connect peripherals. Even a wired usb keyboard and mouse can be too much for a pi zero, I've found. 

### Storage 

A server should have more memory available.  

32GB is good for a server installation.  

64GB is good to use for a camera installation. (TODO: confirm pi zero can create a file system that big. Should work).  


## Operating System

[OS Selection & Installation](./os/index.md)  


Once you've got your system install, it's time to configure what the system runs: [Ubuntu](../system/linux/ubuntu.md)



## Projects Using Pi

### Camera

[Camera](./hardware/camera.md)

### Time clock

aka a Digital Time Keeping System

### Media server

Run docker to allow multiple services on the same server.  

Docker image for plex somewhere?
