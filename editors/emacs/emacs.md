# Emacs

What? No documentation for emacs? 

Well, it's kind of old school. But it's a good text editor. 

Settings and configurations accumulate over time. My current ones are available under this repository. 

It's also okay to start clean or update these over time. 

One of the first things to do is to set up some sane key bindings. Yes, I know the default ones in emacs are optimized for hand efficient hand movement. But they're really non-standard, and they get in the way when switching to just about any other typical computing platform. 


keymaps for emacs are in (TODO):
~/.emacs
