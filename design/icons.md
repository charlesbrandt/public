# Icons

## TODO

A system to create tags / components for a system
easy to drop in the files you want
bundler can pass them through

an easy component

by using the icon, it gets included automatically
(no separate tracking for the ones that are used... that is madness!)

subtractive synthesis
include whatever you want during development

use the downloadable system

sort through tags
pick favorites
keep these around for future logins

store results back to a server

your collection makes you who you are
how you design

this is I would like too
maybe more than music_server

or includes a submodule
i would like == search


this can build up icons based on foundations

what is the underlying grid? (12"x12" split up as any number of sub divisions)


## Libraries / Fonts / Collections

For now, I find it easiest to include the font in my header CSS, and then move on. 
Sure, it's ideal to compile and only bundle those fonts that are in use. 
This is not necessary early on.

not sure why these have fallen out of favor
is it the prefixes needed? ('fa', 'fas', etc)

### Bulma

Bulma doesn't provide icons -- it's a CSS framework. But it does work with the popular icon fonts.

### Vuetify

Icons — Vuetify.js

Material Design Icons are configured by default in Vuetify.

Shouldn't need to do anything else to use them. 

when do they require the 'mdi-' prefix? (don't see it in the demo)

    <v-icon>mdi-folder-open</v-icon>


## Inclusion / Compilation / Installation

Different approaches. Stick with what works for you
