Greeting windows user!
It's time to set up a system!
This file might look like gobbledygood (due to incorrect line returns)
That will be fixed when you install and use Emacs to edit text files.

But first, the best thing to do with a new system, especially one that doesn't have installation media, is to make an image of the drive.  Boot to linux and use dd to copy for a portable way to do this on all machines (not using a proprietary backup imaging mechanism). This way you can always go back to the factory state of the system.  

Or, if you're using virtualization, see virtualization.txt for notes on setting up your virtual machine.

Windows 7 creates a homegroup automatically for you.

*2008.05.30 18:34 emacs
Install and configure emacs
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/Getting-Emacs.html#Getting-Emacs
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/

open the compressed version and copy it to C:\Program Files (or someplace else you have permission to use)
to add start menu shortcuts, you can use:
emacs-23.3\bin\addpm.exe

Make a desktop shortcut to the runemacs shortcut supplied with emacs

*2009.12.28 08:43
Copy emacs startup files locally
with windows it is not possible to link to directories, so any time you make changes to the configuration files that you want available on other machines, you will want to copy those files into your main (synchronized) repository manually anyway.
Plus, with windows, there are usually special configurations that are not needed on other systems.

*2008.05.30 17:56 emacs init windows
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/Installing-Emacs.html#Installing-Emacs

I just went with the root of C:\

3.5 Where do I put my init file?

On Windows, the .emacs file may be called _emacs for backward compatibility with DOS and FAT filesystems where filenames could not start with a dot. Some users prefer to continue using such a name, because Explorer cannot create a file with a name starting with a dot, even though the filesystem and most other programs can handle it. In Emacs 22 and later, the init file may also be called .emacs.d/init.el. Many of the other files that are created by lisp packages are now stored in the .emacs.d directory too, so this keeps all your Emacs related files in one place.

All the files mentioned above should go in your HOME directory. The HOME directory is determined by following the steps below:

   1. If the environment variable HOME is set, use the directory it indicates.
   2. If the registry entry HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs\HOME is set, use the directory it indicates.
   3. If the registry entry HKLM\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs\HOME is set, use the directory it indicates. Not recommended, as it results in users sharing the same HOME directory.
   4. If C:\.emacs exists, then use C:/. This is for backward compatibility, as previous versions defaulted to C:/ if HOME was not set.
   5. Use the user's AppData directory, usually a directory called Application Data under the user's profile directory, the location of which varies according to Windows version and whether the computer is part of a domain. 

Within Emacs, <~> at the beginning of a file name is expanded to your HOME directory, so you can always find your .emacs file with C-x C-f ~/.emacs.

*2008.05.30 14:58 python path windows
This allows python to be found by just typing "python" in the Command Prompt:

http://www.imladris.com/Scripts/PythonForWindows.html
Right-click on the desktop icon for your machine (captioned My Computer, if you haven't renamed it) and go to Properties.
(Or Control Panel -> System and Security -> System

This pops up a dialogue box of system information; click on the Advanced tab and then on the Environment Variables  button. In the new dialogue that pops up, click on the Path variable in the System Variables box; then click the Edit button.

Place your cursor in the Variable Value textbox, right before the final double-quote of the string. Type a semicolon (to separate the previous value from the one you're about to add) and then type the location of the python executable on your system-- probably something like C:\Python . Click OK until you're out of all the dialogue boxes. Now, when you type python at any DOS command prompt, Windows will be able to automatically find and run the correct executable.

no need to keep them there
