# Data Visualization (Data Viz)

Start with the question you're trying to answer. 

example: How many people visited on a given day? 

Then consider how you would like to present that data. 

Use whatever tool is available to you. 


There are a few basic charts / layouts that are common for a reason. It helps to understand how they map to data. 

Pie chart..
you count some number of things in different categories. 
You want to show it. 

Just pass those numbers to a PieChart object... it should be able to do the rest. 

Defining the series is important.  
The key is really in creating series  

Summarize your data. 

Consider the basics. What data do you want to show? 

The trick seems to be in getting the data converted into a format that works well for the visualization.

### Plotly / D3 / VisX

Plotly is built on top of D3 and has a high level API for common charts.

npm install plotly.js-dist 
yarn add plotly.js-dist
```


```

### Installation



### Disable chart title

```
title:{
    text:''
}
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15930661/is-there-a-way-to-disable-the-title-and-subtitle-in-highcharts

### Disable high charts logo

I stash this at the top of the options
```
      pieChartOptions: {
        credits: {
          enabled: false,
        },

        chart: {
          plotBackgroundColor: null,
          plotBorderWidth: null,
          plotShadow: false,
          type: 'pie',
        },
```

### Template

Consider starting with a new component so you can group all of the logic in with the chart... 
may want to include it elsewhere

```
<template>
  <div>
    <highcharts :options="usersChartOptions"></highcharts>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { Chart } from 'highcharts-vue'

export default {
  name: 'UsersChart',
  components: {
    highcharts: Chart,
  },

  data() {
    return {
      items: [],
      pointStart: null,
      usersChartOptions: {
        credits: {
          enabled: false,
        },
        chart: {
          plotBackgroundColor: null,
          plotBorderWidth: null,
          plotShadow: false,
          // did not seem to have any effect
          // displayErrors: true,
        },
        title: {
          text: 'Users Per Day',
        },
        xAxis: {
          type: 'datetime',
        },
        series: [
          {
            name: 'Number of Users',
            // colorByPoint: true,
            type: 'line',
            pointInterval: 24 * 3600 * 1000, // one day
            data: [],
          },
        ],
      },
    }
  },

  computed: {},

  methods: {
    getItems() {
      this.$http.get(`${this.$config.api}/users/all`).then((response) => {
        this.items = response.data.slice(1)
        console.log('Stats -> Items', this.items)
        this.usersChartOptions.series[0].data = this.usersPerDay()
        this.usersChartOptions.series[0].pointStart = this.pointStart
      })
    },
    usersPerDay() {
      let lookup = {}
      let day = ''
      let ts = 0
      for (var item of this.items) {
        console.log('Checking item', item)
        day = item.createDate.substring(0, 10)
        ts = Date.parse(day)
        // console.log('Timestamp: ', ts)
        if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(lookup, ts)) {
          lookup[ts] += 1
        } else {
          lookup[ts] = 1
        }
      }
      console.log('Lookup', lookup)

      let dayInMS = 24 * 3600 * 1000
      let series = []
      // these should be in milliseconds
      let keys = Object.keys(lookup).sort()
      console.log('lookup keys', keys)
      this.pointStart = Number(keys[0])

      let dates = this.range(keys[0], keys[keys.length - 1], dayInMS)
      console.log('dates range', dates)

      // keep track of a running total
      let tally = 0
      for (ts of dates) {
        // console.log('checking for', ts)
        if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(lookup, ts)) {
          tally += lookup[ts]
        }
        series.push(tally)
      }
      console.log('Users Chart Series', series)
      return series
    },
    range(start = 0, end = undefined, step = 1) {
      // console.log('range called with', start, end, step)
      start = parseInt(start)
      end = parseInt(end)
      step = parseInt(step)

      let result = [start]
      while (start < end) {
        start += step
        if (start <= end) {
          result.push(start)
        }
      }
      return result
    },
  },
  mounted() {
    this.getItems()
  },

### Custom formatting

Trying to format a tooltip with custom markup. 

It turned out to be more difficult than expected. I ended up updating the data that is used to generate the graph to be in the desired format from the beginning. Then adjusting labels is easier to do.
