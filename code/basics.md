# Code Basics

Programming doesn't have to be hard. 

Sure, it can be as challenging as you want to make it. 

But if you stick with some basic patterns, then it's just a matter of describing the behavior that you want to see. 

## Core Concepts

 - Variables
 - Conditionals
 - Loops
 - Functions
 
If you only learn 4 things about programming, make it these 4. :)
