# Testing

If a project has an established testing framework, use that. Try running them. See where something breaks if you make a change. Does it break? Does it flag an error in the test? If not, add a test to check for the existence of your change. 

If a project doesn't have an existing testing suite in place, consider [Cypress](cypress.md)
