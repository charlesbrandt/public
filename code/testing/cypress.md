# Cypress

I like to use [docker with development](../../system/virtualization/docker-compose.md). 

Cypress stands out as a compelling solution if green-fielding a project

[Cypress Installation Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements)

Found a good way to integrate it with containers. See [web-ui-api-db](https://gitlab.com/charlesbrandt/web-ui-api-db).
