# Vue 3

## Composition API

Reading up on Vue3's new "Composition API"

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html#standalone-computed-properties


`ref` is used for single variables. Values must be accessed via `item.value()`

`reactive` is used for javascript objects

If the composable only consists of Javascript, no need for a .vue file, just keep it in a .js file. (otherwise .vue files are an option too. Just pick the right one so syntax highlighting works)

Install with Nuxt version 2

Now, in `<script>` sections of components, use

```
export default {
  setup() {

  ...

  },
}
```

and explicitly make reactive objects by calling `reactive?()`
