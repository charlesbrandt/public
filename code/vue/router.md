# Routing

Internal links within an application use `router-link`

```
<router-link to="/foo">Go to Foo</router-link>
```

To include the current view within a template, use the special slot:

```
<router-view></router-view>
```

A really good talk at vueconf (2021) about some of the magic being done by vue-router. 

Great video by VueMastery -- should definitely check out their great videos and support the community while you're at it. They support Vue! :)
