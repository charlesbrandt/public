It's important to understand the distinction between API documentation, API specifications, and API definitions

Understanding the Differences Between API Documentation, Specifications, and Definitions

> API documentation, API specifications, and API definitions are all related, but they are different entities. And each of these serves an important purpose.

> The documentation tells developers and other API consumers how to use the API. After all, how can your API be successful if developers donâ€™t know how to use it?

> An API specification provides a broad understanding of the functionality of the API and the expected results. The specification is largely about the design of the API or your design philosophy. API design and functionality are key factors when choosing to integrate an API with an application.

> And finally, the API definition is about machine consumption of an API and providing a machine-readable format for use by automated tools like automatic API documentation and SDK generators.
