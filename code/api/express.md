# Express

A minimalist foundation for starting a web API in [Javascript](../javascript/index.md). 

https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html  
Installing Express  

For debugging system configurations, it helps to spin up a known working server. "Hello world" is always a good place to start:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`))
```

Express "Hello World" example  

## Requests 

When express receives a request, it parses the request and makes attributes available in the `req` value. 

req.params contains route parameters (in the path portion of the URL)

req.query contains the URL query parameters (after the ? in the URL).

req.body contains anything in the request body. Typically this is used on PUT and POST requests.

http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query

## Routing

Once a project grows beyond "Hello World", collect routes in various .js files. 

In the app, these can be included with:

```
var birds = require('./birds')

// ...

app.use('/birds', birds)
```

and may look something like:

```
var express = require('express')
var router = express.Router()

// middleware that is specific to this router
router.use(function timeLog (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now())
  next()
})
// define the home page route
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Birds home page')
})
// define the about route
router.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('About birds')
})

module.exports = router

```

It is acceptable to provide multiple functions in the route. There are different ways to format these, including as an array of functions to call:

### Nested Routes

http://katieleonard.ca/blog/2016/nested-routes-with-expressjs/

## Development

When developing an API, it can be cumbersome to have to manually restart the server every time there is a code change. Want some type of watch mode. 

Be sure to disable this when deploying the API to production.

Depending on what you use to manage the node processes, your options may vary

### Docker

Nodemon may work here

https://github.com/remy/nodemon

```
npm install --save-dev nodemon 
```

then run with 
```
npx nodemon
```

An example for `docker-compose.yml`

```
  api:
    # image: node:14
    build:
      context: ./api
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: boilerplate_api
    volumes:
      - .:/srv/boilerplate/
      - boilerplate_api_modules:/srv/boilerplate/api/node_modules
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:3030:3030
    working_dir: /srv/boilerplate/api

    # development
    command: sh -c "npm install && npx nodemon boilerplate-api.js"

    # in production, no need to run with a watcher
    # command: sh -c "npm install && npm run start"
    # DEBUG=express:* node ./api/boilerplate-api.js
    # entrypoint: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
```

### PM2

PM2 watch mode



### Debugging

To see all the internal logs used in Express, set the DEBUG environment variable to express:* when launching your app.

    DEBUG=express:* node index.js

https://expressjs.com/en/guide/debugging.html

You can also use `curl` or `wget` to test specific routes that are available. 


## Logging

Morgan makes it easy to log all requests made to the service.

Winston allows logging custom messages.

## Boilerplates

Boilerplates are tricky -- it's rare to find one that sets things up just the way you want. However, they're a great way to learn about new tools and techniques, and to see where a community is headed. 

This is a nice one that focuses on **just** the server / backend:

I like the structure of this one for **both** client and server (but not sure that I agree with all of the dependencies):
