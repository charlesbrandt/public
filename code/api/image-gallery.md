# Image Gallery

Serving images and keeping track of image metadata is an important aspect to most application APIs.

Binary data is not a good fit for a version control system. Binary assets typically don't change as often as an application's code. When changes do happen, the differences between files can be greater.

So a different type of system can help.

A lot of overlap here with databases and persistence / storage stacks. May even be able to use distributed web technologies like IPFS.

Seems like this should be a solved problem. 

However, I think there is work being done
to simplify the process
of delivering the correct image for the most popular scenarios

this also provides some avenue for analytics (how are users viewing your content?)


## Image sizes

Ideally, we only want to send clients the size of an image that will optimally fill the space on their display. Different devices have different resolutions, so that needs to be accounted for.

On the server, we don't want to keep lots of copies of different image resolutions. (e.g. `sizes/` directories)

We certainly want to keep the original. From there it may make sense to keep one more that would cover most large display scenarios. Usually these are much smaller than the original, and make a good starting point for generating even smaller versions dynamically.

## Smart Cropping

A few different approaches that can be taken with cropping intelligently

Can take into account where the subject of interest is in the image
then work to crop towards that


https://github.com/jwagner/smartcrop.js
GitHub - jwagner/smartcrop.js: Content aware image cropping


There is also this crazy tool that manages to edit the image itself to compress or expand features in the picture -- automatically!

## Display Images

Client side -- decide what needs to be displayed, at what size, and when
then push the handling off to the server

https://github.com/strues/retinajs
üí§ GitHub - strues/retinajs: JavaScript, SCSS, Sass, Less, and Stylus helpers for rendering high-resolution image variants


### Lazy loading

An equally important part is on the client, only loading those images that are actually visible. A page may have a lot of content on it. No need to load it unless it's visible

## Image managers and Galleries

Once you have a mechanism to handle resizing on demand

This brings to mind the idea of a gallery or meta data database for images

much that can be done in this space in terms of automating content classification and identification

## Image libraries

To handle generating different sizes, a library for your programming language will help with the task.

Wrapping `libvips` seems like a good approach, and in node there is `sharp` for this.

## Caching

smart caching should happen at this layer
do not store different image sizes on disk like before
(unless you keep one extra besides full size, for thumbs / default ?)

see discussion here:
https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy

caching may not be required here... 
may want it at a different layer of the web application when traffic scales to needing it
