# Image Gallery

Serving images and keeping track of image metadata is an important aspect to most application APIs.

Binary data is not a good fit for a version control system. Binary assets typically don't change as often as an application's code. When changes do happen, the differences between files can be greater.

So a different type of system can help.

A lot of overlap here with databases and persistence / storage stacks. May even be able to use distributed web technologies like IPFS.

## Image sizes

Ideally, we only want to send clients the size of an image that will optimally fill the space on their display. Different devices have different resolutions, so that needs to be accounted for.

On the server, we don't want to keep lots of copies of different image resolutions. (e.g. `sizes/` directories)

We certainly want to keep the original. From there it may make sense to keep one more that would cover most large display scenarios. Usually these are much smaller than the original, and make a good starting point for generating even smaller versions dynamically.

## Image libraries

To handle generating different sizes, a library for your programming language will help with the task.

Wrapping `libvips` seems like a good approach, and in node there is `sharp` for this.
