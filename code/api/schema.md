# Schema

Schema and Models and Types define the data structures of an application. 


## Documenting

Document APIs

Try Open API (previously known as Swagger). 

Or just text.

The best way to ensure that your API documentation is current and accurate is to embed it within your API implementation and then generate the documentation using literate programming techniques, or a framework such as http://apidocjs.com/, http://swagger.io/, or http://raml.org/index.html.
