# Message Queues

Handy tool for distributing work across multiple systems. 

Very nice overview of the concept:

## RabbitMQ

Seems to be a favorite. Has the ability to be accessed from many different languages, which is a limitation of bullmq (js only).

## Bull & BullMQ

Javascript original. Tried and true. Good if you need to support platforms that lag behind from the latest version of Node.

https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull


Latest version. Written in Typescript (but does not require using Typescript). 

https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq


Bull queues can be used by any javascript application easily. 

They only require access to the Redis store being used to coordinate all of the workers. 


Nice to have an easy to include system, especially if it works in javascript.

https://docs.bullmq.io/what-is-bullmq  
What is BullMQ - BullMQ  
https://docs.bullmq.io/  
Quick Start - BullMQ  


```
yarn add bullmq
```

### Connections

Be sure to configure where your redis server is when using the library (and make sure that the location running the code can access the redis server)

https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/connections


```
import { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq'

// Create a new connection in every instance
const myQueue = new Queue('myqueue', { connection: {
  host: "myredis.taskforce.run",
  port: 32856
}});

const myWorker = new Worker('myworker', async (job)=>{}, { connection: {
  host: "myredis.taskforce.run",
  port: 32856
}});
```

### Jobs

One nice thing about using Bull is that it's easy to kick off jobs via your API, especially if you're already running javascript there (e.g. Express)

https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/develop/REFERENCE.md#queueadd

"Boilerplate Request" is the name of the job  
without providing, displays show "__default__" for every job  
however, the job queue needs to leverage that value too  
// .add("Boilerplate Request", req.body)  


```js
var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();
var config = require("../config");

var Queue = require("bull");

const boilerplateQueue = new Queue("boilerplate", config.redis.url);

router.post("/new", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("CREATING NEW BOILERPLATE JOB", req.body);
  boilerplateQueue
    // .add("Boilerplate Request", req.body)
    .add(req.body)
    .then((created) => {
      res.json(created);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      next(err);
    });
});

module.exports = router;
```

#### Child Processes

Often useful to leverage a child process for calling jobs
[Child Processes](/code/javascript/child-process.md)



### Docker

It's a good idea to run your redis store in a separate container, but the bull que and even the bull-board can be added in the API.


Possible to run all the necessary infrastructure under docker. In `docker-compose.yml`, add the following containers and volumes

https://github.com/Deadly0/bull-board-docker

```
  redis:
    container_name: redis
    image: redis:5.0-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 6379:6379
    volumes:
      # - db_redis:/data
      - ./db_redis:/data
```


```
version: "3"
services:

  redis:
    container_name: redis
    image: redis:5.0-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 6379:6379
    volumes:
      - db_redis:/data  
      
  bullboard:
    container_name: bullboard
    image: deadly0/bull-board
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 9998:3000
    environment:
      REDIS_HOST: redis
      REDIS_PORT: 6379
      REDIS_PASSWORD: example-password
      REDIS_USE_TLS: 'false'
      BULL_PREFIX: bull
    depends_on:
      - redis


volumes:
  db_redis:
    external: false


```

Connections leverage ioredis for talking to the Redis database. Note that the version of Redis needs to be 5.0 or higher.

## Bullboard

GitHub - felixmosh/bull-board: ðŸŽ¯ Queue background jobs inspector  

### Install

Seems best to integrate with an existing express stack  
but also possible to put it in its own container if that works better

```
yarn add @bull-board/express
```

```
const express = require('express')
const Queue = require('bull')
const { createBullBoard } = require('@bull-board/api')
const { BullAdapter } = require('@bull-board/api/bullAdapter')
const { ExpressAdapter } = require('@bull-board/express')

const someQueue = new Queue('someQueueName')
const someOtherQueue = new Queue('someOtherQueueName')

const serverAdapter = new ExpressAdapter();

const { addQueue, removeQueue, setQueues, replaceQueues } = createBullBoard({
  queues: [
    new BullAdapter(someQueue),
    new BullAdapter(someOtherQueue),
  ],
  serverAdapter:serverAdapter
})

const app = express()

serverAdapter.setBasePath('/admin/queues')
app.use('/admin/queues', serverAdapter.getRouter());

// other configurations of your server
```
