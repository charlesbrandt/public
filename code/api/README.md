# APIs

Application Programming Interfaces

The place where you persist data (See Also: persistence, storage)

For mostly static binaries, use IPFS (fixed paths on the filesystem is ideal. Need a place to safely track metadata)

For documents that change, use git and .md

For relationships and metadata, use a real database. Postgres seems hard to beat in this.

## DBs 

DBs are Databases.

Databases often tie in closely to the API side.

[databases](databases.md)

## Documenting

Document them.

Try Swagger.

Or just text.

The best way to ensure that your API documentation is current and accurate is to embed it within your API implementation and then generate the documentation using literate programming techniques, or a framework such as http://apidocjs.com/, http://swagger.io/, or http://raml.org/index.html.
