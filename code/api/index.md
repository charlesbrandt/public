# APIs

Application Programming Interfaces

The place where you persist data (See Also: persistence, storage)

For mostly static binaries, use IPFS (fixed paths on the filesystem is ideal. Need a place to safely track metadata)

For documents that change, use git and .md

For relationships and metadata, use a real database. Postgres seems hard to beat for this.
