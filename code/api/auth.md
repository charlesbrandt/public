# Auth

Auth includes both Authentication ('authn') and Authorization ('authz').

## Authentication ('authn') 

Who are you?

Associating a session with a person. (A 'user'.)

## Authorization ('authz')

What can you do?

## Systems

Most [web frameworks](frameworks.md)

The exact system will vary from project to project and team to team.

The underlying concepts and core requirements stay the same.

The Auth system must run on a server. So it will always be part of an API.
