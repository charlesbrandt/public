## Running a server

It's pretty much as simple as having an SSH server running and being able to connect over that.

### New repository on server

Create your project's repo on your git host and check that out locally

When you're not on the server (e.g. created the repo somewhere else), you need to create a blank repo on the server first:

- Log into the server machine.
- Create a bare repo using

```
ssh [user@host-server]
mkdir -p /srv/git/home-system
cd /srv/git/home-system
```

git --version 2.28 and up:

    git init --initial-branch=main --bare

git --version older than 2.28

    git init --bare
    git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main

[via](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42871542/how-can-i-create-a-git-repository-with-the-default-branch-name-other-than-maste)

Check out the new bare repo on the client:

    git clone account@server:/srv/git/project

May get `warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.`
Add some content. At that point, check to see what branch you're on. If it's still set to `master` move it to `main` and push

    git branch -a
    git branch -m main
    git push origin HEAD

#### Add server to existing repo

Note: this requires the remote repository to exist on the server first. 

If you have an existing repo and want to add a server later

- On the client machine check for existing origins

      git remote -v

  (if you need to delete an existing origin):

      git remote remove origin

- push your repo to the server

      git remote add origin ssh://user@server:/GitRepos/myproject.git

  followed by

      git push origin main

May also need

     git branch --set-upstream-to origin/main

Try git show-ref to see what refs you have. Is there a refs/heads/master?

You can try git push origin HEAD:master as a more local-reference-independent solution. This explicitly states that you want to push the local ref HEAD to the remote ref master (see the git-push refspec documentation).

[via](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4181861/message-src-refspec-master-does-not-match-any-when-pushing-commits-in-git)

then checkout to any device with:

    git clone user@server:/srv/git/repo

If the repo on the server has local files checked out (not bare), when it's time to push changes up to the server, they'll be rejected.

Being able to push is the important option in this scenario.

An alternative solution could use different branches on either the remote device and/or the server. This seems more cumbersome.

## Template repositories

Some hosts make it easy to designate a repository as a template.

## Gitlab

Gitlab offers more than just git repository hosting.

https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in

### Add SSH keys

https://gitlab.com/profile/keys

Paste your public SSH key, which is usually contained in the file '~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub' or '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' and begins with 'ssh-ed25519' or 'ssh-rsa'. Don't use your private SSH key.


### Create a new project

Use `+` sign on nav bar.


### Mirror existing projects

Have to decide on push or pull. 

#### Push

SSH Keys are preferred these days. Will need to configure one from gitlab to github. 


To set up a mirror from GitLab to GitHub, you need to follow these steps:

    Create a GitHub personal access token with the public_repo box checked.
    https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
    
    

In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
Settings icon in the user bar

In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.
Developer settings

In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens.
Personal access tokens

Click Generate new token. 

Keep track of the token in your password manager (or you may need to regenerated it again later and then update it in Gitlab)


    Fill in the Git repository URL field using this format: https://<your_github_username>@github.com/<your_github_group>/<your_github_project>.git.
    Fill in Password field with your GitHub personal access token.
    Click the Mirror repository button. 

The mirrored repository will be listed. For example, https://*****:*****@github.com/<your_github_group>/<your_github_project>.git.

The repository will push soon. To force a push, click the Update now () button. 

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html#pushing-to-a-remote-repository


    Log in to Gitlab

    Navigate to your projectâ€™s Settings > Repository and expand the Mirroring repositories section.
    Enter a repository URL.
    Select Push from the Mirror direction dropdown.
    Select an authentication method from the Authentication method dropdown, if necessary.
    Check the Only mirror protected branches box, if necessary.
    Check the Keep divergent refs box, if desired.
    Click the Mirror repository button to save the configuration. 

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html


#### Pull

For initial pulls / importing repositories, do that during "Create a new project" steps. (https://gitlab.com/projects/new#import_project)

To pull in changes from github, generate a token, then add it to gitlab for import from github. 

https://github.com/settings/tokens

https://gitlab.com/import/github/status


### Identity

TODO:
way to have a private email address associated with gitlab?
Sure! 


## Github

Github is a community organized around developing software. 

Acquired / owned by Microsoft. 

### Packages

This is a new feature:
