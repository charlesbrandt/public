## Interpreters

The most common interpreter is the one that runs in every web browser. 

[Node](node.md)  

[Child Processes](child-process.md)  

NodeJS is a good interpreter to use for server side processing. 

```
node -v

things work better if running a newer version:
command -v nvm
```

if you need to install, see [Node](node.md) notes.
