# Frameworks

Typically, in javascript, frameworks refer to front-end frameworks. 

Bulma
Vuetify

Trying to decide between those two.

If you're already using Vue, then vuetify is nicely integrated. 

However, Bulma seems like the way things are heading. 

A standardization for the terms to use. Moving forward.
