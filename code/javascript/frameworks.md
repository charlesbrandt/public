# Frameworks

A framework can mean different things in different contexts. Even within the context of javascript, there are application frameworks like Vue, React, or Angular. 

This document focuses on front-end frameworks. Front-end javascript frameworks quickly blur into CSS only frameworks. It's a rapidly evolving landscape, but here are some top picks:

Bulma
Vuetify
Tailwinds

## Bulma

Bulma seems like a well thought out structure. Buefy adds integration with Vue. 


## Vuetify

Vuetify is also integrated with Vue and provides tree-shaking.
