# Javascript

Javascript, JS, ECMAScript

Javascript is not the same as Java (despite the confusing name similarities). 

Here are some good introductions to working with javascript:

## Interpreters

The most common interpreter is the one that runs in every web browser. NodeJS is a good interpreter to interact with directly

```
node -v

things work better if running a newer version:
command -v nvm
```

if you need to install, see [Node](node.md) notes.

### Variable Names

Seems like camelCase is preferred over names_with_underscores. names-with-hyphens are not allowed.

### Spread Operator

'...' Three dots in front of an array expands it out. Can be used to copy.
