# Code Conventions

Conventions get defined in linting config files these days.

## Case

camelCase is used heavily in Javascript

snake_case is less popular, but a useful alternative, especially in databases and backends where case can be problematic. Works fine in templates without flipping to kebab case
kebab-case is good in urls, filenames and as ids (not good for variable names in code. `-` gets interpreted as a minus)
