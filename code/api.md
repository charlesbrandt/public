# APIs

Application Programming Interfaces

Document them. 

Try Swagger. 

Or just text. 



The best way to ensure that your API documentation is current and accurate is to embed it within your API implementation and then generate the documentation using literate programming techniques, or a framework such as http://apidocjs.com/, http://swagger.io/, or http://raml.org/index.html.
