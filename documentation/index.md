# Writing documentation

Documentation helps.

Writing documentation is a good way to learn new lessons. 

Writing documentation is an art. It's a chance to imagine and envision the solution you seek.

If you already write documentation, thanks for making the time. A lesson may seem obvious after learning it. It's also easy to forget, and it's not always easy to get started. 

   - Open a text editor, [any text editor](../system/editors/)

   - Jot down notes, thoughts, or any other related ideas that come to mind. These can be refined after subsequent revisions.

   - Add visual elements to make it easier to understand
     ```
     <img src="screenshots/" alt="">
     ```

   - Create a context to collect related materials. This may be a folder or directory on your system, or anything else like that.

   - Rinse and repeat :)


## Markdown

Markdown is a nice format for writing documentation. Use any editor. The resulting text is easy to read without additional formatting.

[Quick Reference](markdown.md)  
[Syntax](markdown-syntax.md)


## Markup

Markdown can include snippets of HTML and those will be rendered correctly.

Eventually, you may need the full power of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
especially if you're documenting those systems... In that case it helps to have working examples.

## Screenshots, Photos

Taking a screenshot, taking a photo -- these are very useful tools to quickly capture the gist of a moment. Up there in importance with the use of a text editor.

[Screenshots](screenshots.md)  


## Screen Capture

Videos can be helpful tools, especially if there is more than just a terminal in use. 

[Open Broadcast Studio](obs.md)

## Camera / Recording

Recording audio, video, or photographic stills are all useful ways to document a time and space. 


## Terminal Capture

Asciienema allows you to record a terminal session and then render it in a web browser to illustrate the necessary commands:

[asciinema](asciinema.md)

## Drawing

Don't forget about pencil and paper. Use any tools that are available to you!

[Drawing](drawing.md)


## Links

Update documentation with links from open browsers is an important step. It helps prevent browser windows from accumulating and rotting. 

Use a browser plugin like [Copy All Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-all-tabs/) to copy all open tab urls to the clipboard. Highlight the most useful / important options; prioritize and sort the remaining ones. Remove extra parameter in search links to make them more readable. 

These few steps help when the topic comes up next time; just having a place to start helps. 

## Notes and Journals

Notes and journals are a good source of raw material for documentation. Jot down a note to yourself, then go back and revise it to be more generally relevant.

## Code

[code is another form of documentation. It's easy to run and test](../code/)

## Naming Conventions

See also: TODO: [style guides]

As in, what is the right filename to use?

index? README? one-page? start_here? the name of the parent directory?



## Pull existing docs in the form of a website

If a good source already exists, it may not be necessary to reinvent the wheel. However, it's useful to revise, edit and highlight important sections. 

Consider downloading a source to have existing documentation offline:

    wget --recursive --domains example.org http://www.exampe.org/
