# Setup System

These can get personal. Use the tools that work for you!


## Git

Git is installed by default on some systems. Others may need it. Be sure to grab it:

    sudo apt install git

Then you can clone this repository:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/charlesbrandt/public
    
[Notes on using git](../code/version_control/git.md)

If you forgot to get submodules:

    cd public
    git submodule update --init --recursive
