# Browsers

The window to the internet.  
Settings for an optimal session. 


## Firefox

Running multiple browsers with different profiles helps keeps active references in the right place. When the work is finished, just close that browser. Good for keeping memory free. 

If you need a browser context for a specific task / job

`firefox -p` does the trick! 

If no relevant profile is available, just create one.

Be sure to set Menu -> Preferences -> Restore previous session.  
Pick your preferred search engine while you're at it!

Un-check "Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order" option


### Tab Suspender

'Auto Tab Discard' does what I'm after. Closest working alternative to 'The Great Suspender'

### Ad Blockers

Instead of adblock, I have been exploring a more general filter / tracking blocker:

https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/

Beware of false immitations:

### Tab Links

When creating documentation, it is useful to be able to copy all open tabs in a window. 


https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-all-tabs/  
Copy All Tabs :: Add-ons for Firefox

have used this in the past as well:  
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-urls-expert/?src=search  
and this may have similar functionality  
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus  

OneTab?


### New Tab

This is optional. 

I love pocket. 

Tabliss is a clean minimal alternative. 

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/

https://tabliss.io/

https://github.com/joelshepherd/tabliss

An open source, pluggable New Tab web extension written in TypeScript, React and Redux.

No special permissions required!


## Keyboard Shortcuts

Tab Navigation

Ctrl+Tab

Default is to "Cycle through Tabs in Recently Used Order". I prefer sequential orders. ("Go one Tab to the Left" or "Go one Tab to the Right" with Ctrl+Tab+Shift)

## Chrome / Chromium:

For non-linux machines, go with Chrome:
https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/

Otherwise:
http://www.chromium.org

   sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

### Settings

Change "On startup" to: 

"Continue where you left off"

to restore previous session.
