# Browsers

The window to the internet.  
Settings for an optimal session. 

## Firefox

Running multiple browsers with different profiles helps keeps active references in the right place. When the work is finished, just close that browser. Good for keeping memory free. 

If you need a browser context for a specific task / job

`firefox -p` does the trick! 

If no relevant profile is available, just create one.

Be sure to set Menu -> Preferences -> Restore previous session.  
Pick your preferred search engine while you're at it!

### Tab Links

and this may have similar functionality

### Tab Suspender

'Auto Tab Discard' does what I'm after. Closest working alternative to 'The Great Suspender'

### Ad Blockers

Instead of adblock, I have been exploring a more general filter / tracking blocker:
