# Browsers

The window to the internet.  
Settings for an optimal session. 

## Firefox

Running multiple browsers with different profiles helps keeps active references in the right place. When the work is finished, just close that browser. Good for keeping memory free. 

If you need a browser context for a specific task / job

`firefox -p` does the trick! 

If no relevant profile is available, just create one.

Be sure to set Menu -> Preferences -> Restore previous session.  
Pick your preferred search engine while you're at it!

### Tab Links

have used this in the past as well:

OneTab?

### Tab Suspender

'Auto Tab Discard' does what I'm after. Closest working alternative to 'The Great Suspender'

### Ad Blockers

Instead of adblock, I have been exploring a more general filter / tracking blocker:  
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/

## Chrome / Chromium:

For non-linux machines, go with Chrome:
https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/

Otherwise:
http://www.chromium.org

   sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

### Settings

Change "On startup" to: 

"Continue where you left off"

to restore previous session.

The Great Suspender!
Suspend Tabs after a certain period of inactivity
This is great!
Saves so much memory and resources!
