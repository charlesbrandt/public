# System

The underlying systems can change over time, so I like to keep notes about the tools and configurations that help me use those systems more efficiently.

## Hardware

A computer is hardware that runs software. These devices power the systems and applications we've come to rely on. 

If you're just getting familiar with learning about computers, the [Raspberry Pi](/pi/) ecosystem is a great place to start. Heavy overlap and a great inexpensive entry point. Learning is part of the process.

Computers are defined by three general properties; how much: computational processing power (CPU), memory, and storage. 

Memory and storage may seem like the same, but for now memory is a fast storage system that only exists while power is supplied. Storage is slightly slower for reading and writing, but the information persists after power is removed.

## Boot

The boot sequence gets the system started so it is ready to run software. 

[Startup](startup.md)  


## Operating Systems

Set up a computer with a fresh operating system.

If you don't already have a preferred operating system, consider one that is open source. Open source software is a wonderful thing, [but don't just take my word for it.](https://opensource.guide)

Linux is the most common on desktop machines in the open source world. There are many flavors:

In the mobile phone space, Android is a good open source solution.

## Applications 

[Browsers](browsers.md)  

[Editors](editors/)  

[Applications](applications.md)  

[Password Managers](password-manager.md)  

## Search

From the command line


```
find * -iname "*search-term*"
```

to find files that match a pattern.
