# System

The underlying systems can change over time, so I like to keep notes about the tools and configurations that help me use those systems more efficiently.

## Applications 

[Browsers](browsers.md)  

[Editors](editors/)  

[Applications](applications.md)  

[Password Managers](password-manager.md)  

## Search

From the command line


```
find * -iname "*search-term*"
```

to find files that match a pattern.

## Terminals

Other keywords include: bash, shell

[Terminal](terminal/index.md)

[Tmux](terminal/tmux.md)  

[SSH](terminal/ssh.md)  

Bash Colors example available in <a href="terminal/bash-colors.sh">terminal/bash-colors.sh</a>

### Moving Files

`mv` command seems so basic, so straightforward. 

Reminder: `mv -b` is useful for creating backups of any files that exist in the destination directory. If merging two big directories with some overlapping files, this is a useful option to be able to compare once everything is in the same place.

## Administration

[Checksums](checksums.md)  
[Firewall](firewall.md)  
[Network](network.md)  
[Nginx](nginx.md)  
[Remote Desktop](remote-desktop.md)  
[Startup Services](startup-services.md)  

[Disk Usage](drives/disk-usage.md)  

## Virtualization

## Hardware

A computer is hardware that runs software. These devices power the systems and applications we've come to rely on. 

If you're just getting familiar with learning about computers, the [Raspberry Pi](/pi/) ecosystem is a great place to start. Heavy overlap and a great inexpensive entry point. Learning is part of the process.

Computers are defined by three general properties; how much: computational processing power (CPU), memory, and storage. 

### Storage

Memory and storage may seem like the same, but for now memory is a fast storage system that only exists while power is supplied. Storage is slightly slower for reading and writing, but the information persists after power is removed.

## Operating Systems

Set up a computer with a fresh operating system.

Linux is common on desktop machines in the open source world. There are many flavors:

[Linux](linux/)  

In the mobile phone space, Android is a good open source solution.

[Android](android/)  

If you don't already have a preferred operating system, consider one that is [open source.](https://opensource.guide)

Windows and Mac OS X are good options too. 

### Boot

The boot sequence gets the system started so it is ready to run software.
