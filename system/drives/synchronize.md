# Synchronize Drives

rsync is the simplest way to synchronize two drives. 

I often leave notes in sync.txt with the specific commands used. 

I forget... do I keep a slash at the end? or does that cause it to be in a subdirectory. 


## Comparisons / Diff

There is also a utility called meld. Haven't tried that yet. Notes?

how to compare two directories

    diff -q directory-1/ directory-2/

or recurse into subdirectories:

    diff -qr directory-1/ directory-2/
    
    sudo apt install meld
