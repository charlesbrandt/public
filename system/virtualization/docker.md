# Docker

Docker implements a container solution. Containers are a lighter weight alternative to a full virtual machine. They are run on the host operating system, but they are encapsulated to provide isolation, security, and compartmentalization.

## Installation

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Convenience Script

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script

This may be more up-to-date (and straightforward) than the process outlined below:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

DRY_RUN=1 sh ./get-docker.sh
```


### Apt Repository

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository

20.10 
raspberry pi -- this worked: https://linuxhint.com/install_docker_raspberry_pi-2/

```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
    
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

20.04 and before


```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

```

update again

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

on a Raspberry Pi 4 8gb using ubuntu 64bit

```
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=arm64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

### Docker Compose

At this point Docker should be installed and you can verify with:

    sudo systemctl status docker

Go ahead and grab docker-compose

    sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y

### Add user to docker group

This allows you to execute docker without using sudo
that's a good thing!

```
sudo groupadd docker

sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

Log out and log back in, or:

    su - ${USER}
    
Test that you have permissions to run docker commands without sudo:

    docker ps

### Create bash aliases

dcu
docker-compose up -d

dcd
docker-compose down --remove-orphans

dce

dcl

Add the following to your `.bashrc` file (or equivalent)

```
alias dcu='docker-compose up -d'
alias dcd='docker-compose down --remove-orphans'
alias dcp='docker-compose ps'
alias dce='docker-compose exec'
alias dcl='docker-compose logs'
```

### Rootless & Permissions

To run Docker as a non-privileged user, consider setting up the
Docker daemon in rootless mode for your user:

    dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

Visit https://docs.docker.com/go/rootless/ to learn about rootless mode.


To run the Docker daemon as a fully privileged service, but granting non-root
users access, refer to https://docs.docker.com/go/daemon-access/

WARNING: Access to the remote API on a privileged Docker daemon is equivalent
         to root access on the host. Refer to the 'Docker daemon attack surface'
         documentation for details: https://docs.docker.com/go/attack-surface/


### Snap 

Maybe this approach would help keep networking devices separate? 

Worth a try on future desktop setups. 

Command 'docker' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo snap install docker     # version 18.09.9, or
sudo apt  install docker.io

Are these kept in sync with the apt versions?





## Status

```
systemctl status docker
```

To see a list of *currently running* docker containers:

```
docker ps
```

To see the name of the container (and the size of disk in use):

```
docker ps -s 
```

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/


## Restarting

Containers can be set to restart automatically. As long as the parent docker process is configured to run at start up (usually is by default), then those containers will restart automatically. 

You could also do a systemctrl setup like:

`sudo systemctl enable docker-MYPROJECT-oracle_db.service`

As described in

## Shares & Storage

It is possible to share storage between the host and containers. For a general overview:

https://docs.docker.com/storage/

Bind Mounts are shares data between the container and the host:

https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/

Volumes are encapsulated in the container engine itself (managed separately from the host):

https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/

For development, a bind mount may work well. For deployments, a volume is a better choice. 

These can be specified when running a container, or as part of a compose setup:

```
docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name devtest \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)"/target,dst=/app \
  nginx:latest
```

### Copy Data

You can copy data into and out of a container manually:

// don't use `*` with `docker cp`
docker cp e9f10889f0da:/synthea/output/fhir ui/public/data/

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/  
docker cp | Docker Documentation  



## Images

See a list of available docker images (see what is currently available):

    docker image ls -a

Is equivalent to:

    docker images

docker images are stored in:

    /var/lib/docker
    
(don't forget, docker sometimes run in a VM, so this location is on that VM)
via:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19234831/where-are-docker-images-stored-on-the-host-machine

### Official Images

https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image&image_filter=official

Different dependencies will result in different sized containers. Smaller is generally better, everything else being the same:

https://www.brianchristner.io/docker-image-base-os-size-comparison/

https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile determines how your image is configured (and ultimately what is run in your container). These can be tracked as part of the project's source code. 

https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/

to keep a container running, choose a process that won't exit:

    CMD [ "tail", "-f", "/dev/null" ]

See also [dockerfiles](dockerfiles.md)

```
FROM node:lts

# Set the working directory.
WORKDIR /srv
```



### Building

    docker build -t simple-node .
    docker run -p 3000:3000 simple-node

Now you should be able to connect to localhost without specifying a VM host. Without the explicit forward for the port, the port won't be available:

    http://localhost:3000/
    
To specify a Dockerfile, use -f:

    docker build -t simple-node -f Dockerfile.debug .
    
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/

## Running a Container

When you 'run' a command with docker, you specify the docker image to use to run it. The run command will download the image, build the container (if it doesn't exist already), and then run the command in the container.

    docker run mhart/alpine-node node --version
    
Even with single container setups, it may make sense to use docker-compose to specify what the container is named and any volumes that should be mounted. That also makes it easier to integrate with other docker-compose setups. 
    
### Connecting to a Container 

start and connect to a docker container:

    docker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash <imageID>
    docker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash docker_web_run_1

start a new shell in an already running container:

    docker exec -it <containerIdOrName> bash
    docker exec -it 393b12a61839 /bin/sh
    docker exec -it docker_web_run_1 bash

connect to a (already running) docker container (Note: this will share the same shell if another instance is already connected interactively)

    docker attach loving_heisenberg 

via:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/505506/how-to-get-bash-or-ssh-into-a-running-container-in-background-mode

### Stopping a Container

    docker container stop devtest

To stop everything:

    docker stop $(docker ps -q)
    
or 

    docker container stop $(docker container list -q)

### Removing a Container

    docker rm [container]

### Cleaning up old images

```
docker system prune 
```

This seems like a well maintained answer with up-to-date options & descriptions:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32723111/how-to-remove-old-and-unused-docker-images

[via](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=docker-compose+remove+old+images&ia=web)

Some of the following options may be more aggressive in what they delete. Be careful if you have important data stored!

Sometimes when testing builds, docker will complain about running out of space:

```
Thin Pool has 2738 free data blocks which is less than minimum required 2915 free data blocks. Create more free space in thin pool or use dm.min_free_space option to change behavior
```

You can get rid of all images with:

    docker image prune -a --force 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41531962/docker-run-error-thin-pool-has-free-data-blocks-which-is-less-than-minimum-req

Clear everything out (!!! dangerous !!!)

    docker image rm $(docker image ls -a -q)
    docker image rm -f $(docker image ls -a -q)

See also:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_prune/

Still not enough space?
There are some nuclear options outlined here -- they will clear everything out, including volumes that may have data on them!

## Networking

See all networks currently configured:

    docker network ls
    
See details for a specific network:

    docker network inspect bridge

Docker containers can be referenced from other containers using the container name. Be sure to use the full container name, not the abbreviated service name that is used in docker-compose files. 

`ping` is not always available. On debian based containers, install it with:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install iputils-ping

From there, can testing pinging containers by name:

    ping nginx

see a list of all IP addresses for all containers:
sudo docker ps | tail -n +2 | while read cid b; do echo -n "$cid\t"; sudo docker inspect $cid | grep IPAddress | cut -d \" -f 4; done

via:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17157721/getting-a-docker-containers-ip-address-from-the-host


wasn't sure about how to get one container to talk to another...
they've documented that well:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/networkingcontainers/

(on macs) set up a terminal to know how to interact with docker by running:

    eval "$(docker-machine env default)"


way to generalize reference to containers in configuration files?
what if the IP for the api server changes?
would require manually updating nginx.conf file
just use docker name

### DNS

I ran into an issue where a container was not able to resolve DNS lookups. (to confirm this, connect to the container via bash and run `ping google.com`)

This turned out to be an issue with the way lookups are configured on my host machine (20.04). 

Docker uses the host's name resolution. Running this on the host fixes the resolution within containers: 

    sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

The link that helped:

https://serverfault.com/questions/642981/docker-containers-cant-resolve-dns-on-ubuntu-14-04-desktop-host

Note:
If you're using hosts defined in `/etc/hosts`, the updated symlink won't resolve those correctly. See also: ~/alpha/web_ui_api_db/local-development.md


### Troubleshooting connections in docker

https://www.docker.com/blog/why-you-dont-need-to-run-sshd-in-docker

A successful approach was to launch the server, connect to the container using another shell

    apk update
    
this provides the "ss" command for "socket statistics"
RUN apk add --no-cache iproute2
e.g. to see if a server is running on expected port:

    ss -lntp

verify server was on correct ports using above command

    apk add lynx

lynx 127.0.0.1:8080

curl is another good option!

To see what ports are open, install `netstat`. This approach will not persist across restarts. 


    apt update
    apt install net-tools

    netstat -pan | egrep " LISTEN "
    

### Troubleshooting nginx

Go inside the container

`docker-compose exec web bash`

Or to use docker directly:

`docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash` 

[Troubleshooting](../../web/troubleshooting.md)

```
curl http://boilerplate_ui_1:3000
curl -X GET http://boilerplate_ui_1:3000
```

If blank, may be best to connect to the ui directly via host to make sure it's working as expected. 

#### Nginx Logging

Logs are routed to stdout/stderr so that docker can pass them through. 

Verify with check the log location `ls -la /var/log/nginx/` you will see the following output:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   11 Apr 30 23:05 access.log -> /dev/stdout
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   11 Apr 30 23:05 error.log -> /dev/stderr
```

Execute `cat access.log` inside the container and it doesn't show anything.

The way to get your logs is going outside the container and running

    docker logs <container-id>
