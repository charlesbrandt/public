# Kubernetes

Container orchestration.

Abbreviated as 'K8s' because there are eight letters between the 'k' and the 's' in 'kubernetes'.

## Tools

Make sure you have the basics installed locally:

  - Docker  
  - kubectl  
  - kubeadm  


## Cluster Distributions

There are many different ways to configure kubernetes clusters. A common way is to deploy them to a managed cloud service like Google, AWS, or Azure. The exact distribution you use may vary, but the concepts should transfer from one context to another. 

These notes focus on local setups, since that's a good way to learn.

### kubectl

kubectl is the default CLI for managing kubernetes

#### Install kubectl

Make sure you have kubectl installed. You can install kubectl according to the instructions in Install and Set Up kubectl.

    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

    chmod +x ./kubectl
    
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    
    kubectl version


### VS Code 

Use a graphical tool to get an overview of the environment, something as simple as the Kubernetes extension for Visual Studio Code works.

## Deploy a service

Start with something simple. Nginx serving static files seems like a good place to begin. 

## Helm

Configuration Management for the services running on your cluster. Similar to docker-compose.yml files in the Docker ecosystem.

From their site: 

```
Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish â€” so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste.
```

https://helm.sh/

https://github.com/helm/helm

Download an appropriate release:

https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.0.3

Unpack it.

    cd ~/Downloads
    tar zxvf helm-v3.0.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz 
    cd [directory]
    
    helm create [chart-name]
