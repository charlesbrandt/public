# Docker Compose

Docker Compose is included with docker by default.

Create a configuration file for the current project's docker container setup in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Basics

After editing the docker-compose.yml file for the services, launch them with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Then, to bring everything down again:

```
docker compose down -v
```

See what is currently running:

```
docker compose ps
```

If the container is not running, it may not show up in just `docker ps`. You can still see the status in `docker compose ps`

To connect to a running container (or run any command inside it):

```
docker compose exec [name]
```

You can use the short name here, not potentially more verbose container_name

To see what has been happening in a container, check the logs

```
docker compose logs [name]
```

The above commands can get tiring to type every time you want to take action with a compose environment. Shortcuts help. See [Docker notes](docker.md)


## docker-compose.yml

The file that defines all containers to be used for the application. 

One parameter that is helpful is

```
    container_name: mycontainername
```
    
If `contianer_name` is not specified, the parent directory name is used to create a container name. The `container_name` parameter helps keep container names consistent regardless of where they are deployed. This, in turn, makes it easier to create other configuration files that work as expected within the docker network. 

### Base Image

Frequently, container images already exist that meet the requirements. 

Start with an existing docker image for the type of service your application runs in the container. For example, if you're running a node application, in `docker-compose.yml` start with:

``` yaml
  api:
    image: node:lts
```

### Multiple commands

In some cases it may help to run more than one command. You can separate these out into separate compose files (e.g. docker-compose-build.yml), or you could run multiple commands by chaining them together in a `sh` call:

```
command: bash -c "
    python manage.py migrate
    && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
  "
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30063907/using-docker-compose-how-to-execute-multiple-commands

### Custom images (Dockerfile)

If you need to run multiple commands, build a custom image with a dedicated Dockerfile. 

The dockerfile can be specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file with:

```
container-name:
   build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: <Below_Directory>/Dockerfile

```

Reminder:  
Image for service was built because it did not already exist. To rebuild this image you must use `docker compose build` or `docker compose up --build`.


Eventually other additional utilities will need to be available within the container context. (e.g. when you run `docker compose exec api bash` to connect to the container). In that case, use a `Dockerfile` to make those adjustments so the changes persist across restarts. 

``` yaml
  api:
    build:
      context: ./api
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

Note: the `Dockerfile` path is relative to the value for `context`. In this case, the `Dockerfile` would be stored at `./api/Dockerfile`. 

The `image: node:lts` configuration from `docker-compose.yml` becomes `FROM node:lts` in a `Dockerfile` and you can add the rest of the configurations as needed. See also [docker#dockerfile](docker.md#dockerfile)


## Environment Variables

In `docker-compose.yml`, add a section like:

```yaml
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```


It's also possible to put variables in a `.env` file and then reference those variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file

## Volumes

How to persist data across container restarts. 

What is the difference between `external: true` and `external: false`? 

```
volumes:
  boilerplate_ui_modules:
    external: true

  boilerplate_api_modules:
    external: true
```


## Networking

To restrict to local machine only, edit the docker-compose.yml file and change to:

```
        ports:
            - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
```

To restrict a service so it's only available within the container network (not available on the host directly), then use `expose` instead:

```
    expose:
      - 3306
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40801772/what-is-the-difference-between-docker-compose-ports-vs-expose

### Custom Network

Usually it's sufficient to use the default network in a compose file so all containers specified will have access to each other, but not to anything else. 

https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/

If you want to run a number of different applications, but proxy them all behind the same nginx host (running in a different container), it could help to specify the network in the compose file:

```
networks:
  default:
    name: my-pre-existing-network
```


## Rebuilding

Sometimes the Dockerfile changes and you need to let compose know to rebuild everything. 

```
docker compose up -d --no-deps --build
```

via: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36884991/how-to-rebuild-docker-container-in-docker-compose-yml


To rebuild, use:

```
docker compose build
```

Remove all old images

```
docker compose rm
```
    
then rebuild again.


### Rebuilding Images

Rebuild an image from scratch with docker compose 

```
docker compose build --no-cache
```

Useful in instances when, for example, you do a `RUN apt-get update` that rarely gets re-run and then package listings get out of date. 

However, sometimes if you run an action in a Dockerfile like installilng software, the original image still will not be rebuilt. Over time, this can lead to very crusty layers in your docker containers. 

To work around the situation, this seems pretty extreme (especially when there are potentially many other containers on the same system), but it does force docker to pull in all new images:

```
docker system prune -a
```

Heed the warning:

```
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all images without at least one container associated to them
  - all build cache
```

## Troubleshooting 

For troubleshooting, you can add a command that is sure to run in the docker-compose.yml, e.g.:

```
    entrypoint: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]

    entrypoint: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 2073600"]
```

then connect with:

```
docker compose exec SERVICE_NAME bash
```

via:  
https://vsupalov.com/debug-docker-compose-service/

Logging is available via docker directly:

```
docker logs repo_nginx_1
```
 
see also: [docker.md](docker.md)

```
docker network ls
```


## Parameters

### -f 

Specify a configuration file with a name other than `docker-compose.yml`

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.builder.yml 
```

### -p

Using a `container_name` setting in `docker-compose.yml` makes it easy to write configuration files that work as expected. In that case `-p` is rarely needed. 

If no `container_name` parameter is set in docker-compose.yml, by default, the docker project name is the parent directory name. This is usually the case for local development setups.

There are times, however, when it is useful to make directory names that are different than the project name. For example, working on a different branch, it may be easier to use the branch name instead of the project name for the parent directory.

If the parent directory is **not** equal to the project name, you'll want to pass the project name in to all of the above docker compose commands.

Using `-p boilerplate` allows the project name (and consequently the container name) to be consistent from one deployment to the next. That way containers are named with `boilerplate_[service]_1`.

This allows configuration files to be written ahead of time to work.

If you've checked out the repository to a directory named `boilerplate`, the project name `boilerplate` will be assumed by docker and the `-p` option may be omitted.

## Installation

It is no longer required to install Docker Compose separately. Modern `docker` installations include it by default.

### NOTE:
The final Compose v1 release (v1.29.2) was May 10, 2021. These packages haven‚Äôt received any security updates since then. Use at your own risk.
