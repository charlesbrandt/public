# System Administration

Almost everything in `/system` is related to system administration. 

Focus on infrastructure managment tools and techniques here

## Teleport

https://github.com/gravitational/teleport

Teleport is the easiest, most secure way to access all your infrastructure. Teleport is an identity-aware, multi-protocol access proxy which understands SSH, HTTPS, RDP, Kubernetes API, MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL wire protocols.

On the server-side, Teleport is a single binary which enables convenient secure access to behind-NAT resources


Teleport is trivial to set up as a Linux daemon or in a Kubernetes pod. It's rapidly replacing legacy sshd-based setups

Interesting!

Might be similar to how VSCode can work over ssh
