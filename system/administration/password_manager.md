# Password Managers

Encrypting a local file that stores passwords is necessary if you're going to store them digitally.

## KeePass

KeePass is the gold standard as far as open password managers go. There are clients available for most platforms.

    sudo apt-get install keepassx

Is it ok to store encrypted text (e.g. keepass database) in version control? I think so. It seems better than Google Docs. It's easy to clobber changes in Google Docs.

### Android

KeePass DX is good and open source.

### Web

KeeWeb may be a good option to try. Found it via the Open Collective site.

## Lockwise

Lockwise is a newer open source solution from Mozilla that is built in to Firefox:

It looks like there may be some issues with prompting for the password to unlock the database.

## Password Store

I'm interested to try this out... if a CLI is always available on any device, this could work!
