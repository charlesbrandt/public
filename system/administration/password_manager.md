# Password Managers

Encrypting a local file that stores passwords is necessary if you're going to store them digitally.

## KeePass

KeePass is the gold standard as far as open password managers go. There are clients available for most platforms.

KeePass Password Safe

Is it ok to store encrypted text (e.g. keepass database) in version control? I think so. It seems better than Google Docs. It's easy to clobber changes in Google Docs. 

### Web

KeeWeb may be a good option to try. Found it via the Open Collective site.

### Android

KeePass DX is good and open source.



## Password Store

I'm interested to try this out... if a CLI is always available on any device, this could work!
