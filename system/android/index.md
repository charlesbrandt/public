# Android

An open source operating system for mobile devices.

## Settings

Documenting android setup processes happens mostly in the form of screenshots when a new device is set up, but images don't always convey the context clearly.  

### Display

Dark theme -> on

### Haptic Feedback for Keyboard 
disabled haptic feedback for keyboard input

found setting in settings -> system -> languages & input -> virtual keyboard -> gboard -> preferences

enable long press for symbols.

right handed mode makes the keys smaller, but there is less distance to travel. i know one handed is slower, but i find it difficult to hold the phone otherwise

enable glide typing? seems to be disabled in termux?

todo: way to customize the characters available on a virtual keyboard? an arrow key would be nice (i.e. instead of ->)


## Applications

### F-Droid / Termux

F-Droid is an open-source package manager for Android devices. 

No root required. But you do have to know how to install a program outside of the App store. 

F-Droid makes installing Termux easier. Don't use the version of Termux in the Google Play store
