### Haptic Feedback for Keyboard 
disabled haptic feedback for keyboard input

found setting in settings -> system -> languages & input -> virtual keyboard -> gboard -> preferences

enable long press for symbols.

right handed mode makes the keys smaller, but there is less distance to travel. i know one handed is slower, but i find it difficult to hold the phone otherwise

also change theme to dark ... ahhh so much better.
enable glide typing? seems to be disabled in termux?

todo: way to customize the characters available on a virtual keyboard? an arrow key would be nice (i.e. instead of ->)
