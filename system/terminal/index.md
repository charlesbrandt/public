# Terminal

```
cd
rm .bashrc
ln -s ~/public/system/.bashrc .bashrc
```


## Alias vs Functions

interesting discussion came up here:  
~/public/system/virtualization/docker.md

Which is better, an alias or a function? 

#### Function

```
dew() {
  docker-compose exec web $@
}
```

The $@ part handles passing along all of the function’s arguments.

just prefix the command you want to time with `time`!

```
time ls
```

## Environment Variables

Often need to append to the `PATH` so a new executable is matched via the CLI. Should not put in `.bashrc` according to:

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26047/how-to-correctly-add-a-path-to-path

I just put it in `.bashrc` :P

```
PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

No need for `export ` if the variable already exists
