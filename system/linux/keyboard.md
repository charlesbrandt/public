## Characters

Virtual keyboards on phones have built in access for emojis and special character selection. On a desktop, these characters can be harder to find

The app "Characters" will allow you to choose non-standard characters, like emojis, via linux. Had had some difficulty finding a way to do this in the past.

## Remap Keys

Sometimes keyboards have a key that gets in the way, or deviates from other keyboard layouts.

Sounds like `xmodmap` is an old way of mapping keys. As noted in the above thread, those settings don't stick around after a reboot. `xbd` seems to be the way to go for these. 

On my Dell XPS13 laptop, I want to remap the 'pgup' to be 'left' and 'pgdn' to be 'right'. 

    sudo vi /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc

```
    key <PGUP> {        [  Prior                ]       };
    key <PGDN> {        [  Next                 ]       };
```

```
    key <PGUP> {        [  Left                 ]       };
    key <PGDN> {        [  Right                ]       };
```

For mapping the menu key to be a control key on the perixx keyboard:

```
    modifier_map Control{ Control_L, Control_R, Menu };
```

Apply the changes with

    setxkbmap us 

    setxkbmap us intl 
    
This sets it up globally. In my case, that's what I want.

Looks like it's also possible to do this on a per user basis:
