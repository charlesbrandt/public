# Linux

There are many linux distributions available. Which one you run is a matter of personal preference. Communities create a distribution as a standard collection of linux applications and configurations.

When downloading an image, torrents are a good way to share bandwidth. This supports a good cause! Be sure to use a network that you have adequate bandwidth quotas.

## Create Bootable Media

This process is the same for all systems.

Whatever you choose, start by downloading and burning an image of the operating system (OS) of your choice from their site.

To transfer image for use, see [creating a bootable usb](../drives/bootable-usb.md).

## Distributions

## Ubuntu

[Ubuntu](ubuntu.md)  
[Ubuntu Server](ubuntu-server.md)  
[Ubuntu Version](ubuntu-version.md)  

Ubuntu is an open source linux operating system.

http://www.ubuntu.com

Once you have your copy of Ubuntu, boot your computer with it and Ubuntu should load into a "Live" instance.  This is a fully functional Linux system.  Cooool.  With enough memory, the only noticable performance hit comes when the system needs to access a program from the source media.

At this point you are also able to install Ubuntu to a local drive. Whether you run live or install to disk, that's up to you.

### [Desktops / Window Managers](window-managers/)

As if it wasn't enough to choose a distribution, you may also want to choose the [window manager](window-managers/). Typically this choice is made by the specific distribution you run, but some (e.g. arch) allow you to choose as part of the installation process. 

Gnome3 in newer versions of Ubuntu is a solid choice. I enjoy the 'overview' feature where you can see all windows for a given workspace. 

Xubuntu ships with XFCE, which is another good choice. 

Ubuntu Studio is built on top of Xubuntu.

## Servers

For servers, ubuntu server is good

This is a good local mirror for ubuntu: (don't think xubuntu is there)

CentOS is another popular distribution that tracks Red Hat Enterprise Linux


## Raspberry Pi

If you plan to use a Pi as a daily driver / desktop, you may want to customize the desktop / distribution:

To get this to boot with a VM in VirtualBox, I needed to run the following:

    Click settings before starting the VM
    Goto to System
    Look at Extended Features
    Click "Enable I/O APIC"

If the screen appears locked with a clock, slide the screen up to unlock it.

To create a disk image from an img file:

Finally, needed to do the following to boot:

In order overcome the above error and proceed with booting TAILS from an older SanDisk Cruzer stick, hit the `<TAB>` key at the boot prompt. Youâ€™ll see, at the foot of the screen, a series of default switches passed to the boot loader. Arrow key back to the media=removable option and delete it. Ensure you keep the space between successive parameters. Hit `<RETURN>` and TAILS should continue booting per usual. It can be a little slow to boot, particularly from older USB sticks, so be patient.
