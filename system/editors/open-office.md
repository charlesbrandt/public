### Install Java on Ubuntu

Install Java in your Ubuntu system:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install default-jdk
```

For users with more than one version of Java check our guide on [How to set default Java version on Ubuntu](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-set-default-java-version-on-ubuntu-debian/) useful.

To get Java version, run the `java -version` command:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "21.0.4" 2024-07-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu224.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu224.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

### Uninstall LibreOffice

Installing Desktop integration for Apache OpenOffice will fail if LibreOffice is installed. Consider uninstalling it using our guide below.

- [How to Uninstall LibreOffice on Ubuntu](https://computingforgeeks.com/uninstall-libreoffice-on-ubuntu/)

### Download Latest Apache OpenOffice

Visit [Apache Downloads page](https://www.openoffice.org/download/) to pull the latest stable release. Select Linux 64-bit Debian version.

Downloading from the CLI can be done using the wget command:

```
sudo apt install -y wget
VER=4.1.15 #Replace with latest available on site
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/${VER}/binaries/en-US/Apache_OpenOffice_${VER}_Linux_x86-64_install-deb_en-US.tar.gz
```

Replace above URL with the one for the latest Apache OpenOffice package available on the Downloads page.

### Extract and Install Apache OpenOffice

Wait for the download to finish then extract the file.

```
tar xvf Apache_OpenOffice_${VER}_Linux_x86-64_install-deb_en-US.tar.gz
```

Change to `en-US/DEBS` folder created after the extraction and run installer for Apache OpenOffice on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04.

```
cd en-US/DEBS
sudo dpkg -i  *.deb
```

A successful installation should look similar to one below.
