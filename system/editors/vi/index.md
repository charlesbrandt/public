# Vi 


For a while, when doing system administration work on remote servers, `vi` was one of the few editors that could be counted on to be installed. 

vi is everywhere. It's good to understand the different modes so that you can accomplish basic editing. 

See `.exrc` for a simple startup script that will map `ctrl-j` to print a timestamp. 

## nano

Many systems also include nano, which also works when you need an editor over a console.
