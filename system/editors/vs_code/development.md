# Extension Development

Generate a boilerplate for a new extension. 

Currently this requires yeoman. If you don't have that package installed, it can take up to 10 minutes to install. 

TOOD:
Any way to do this with `npx`?

Once you've created a new extension, add a new function. 

** Be sure to add the new function in all of the many places needed to register ** (documentation didn't mention this that we saw. Supposed to be self evident?)

  - TODO: confirm
  - 2 x in package.json
  - in file directly
  - others?

## Reloading

TODO: document
F5
Ctrl-R ?
