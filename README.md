# system
A collection of ansible scripts and notes about setting up different systems. Also includes notes on common system administration tasks. These notes change based on current personal configurations. 

When starting a new system, the trick is getting the pieces you need most installed first.  

For (X)Ubuntu systems, see ubuntu.txt for downloading packages and startup.sh for installing them.

These are always changing as systems change.
